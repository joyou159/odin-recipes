            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. 
                    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                    Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
                    Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                    Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,
                    remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                     Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                      Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
                       Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: 
                       to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
                    Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
                </li>
